# HOPE_Hypothesis1

## General
This repository is using the *targets* R package to create a workflow of all the steps needed in the data analyses for testing the hypothesis 1 of the ERC HOPE project if prehistoric human impact altered the fundamental ecological processes. 


To make the code and workflow run you need access to input data and targets data storage. 
The input data is the assembly data that we get from the RFossilpol workflow creating the standardised HOPE dataset. The data input and data storage from targets are in the folder HOPE_Hypothesis1 on Onedrive.

This is under development, more information to come ...
