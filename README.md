# PastHumanImpact

developed by: Ondrej Mottl & Vivian A. Felde

## General

This repository is a part of the ERC HOPE project and is set to estimate if human impact altered the fundamental ecological processes.

The repository consists of modular R-script and individual functions organised by individual tasks, as well as using the {[targets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/)} R package to create workflows for specific subroutines. Therefore, the project is divided into several steps, each step is a separate task (R scripts and/or target pipeline).

### Reference

This code is currently supporting the publication "*Climate outweighs human effects on vegetation properties during the early-to-mid Holocene*": [![static-badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-10.21203/rs.3.rs--4692574/v1-blue)](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4692574/v1)

Note: See [Releases](https://github.com/HOPE-UIB-BIO/PastHumanImpact/releases/) for the version of the code that supports the publication.

## Setup

* `R/___Init_project___.R` - set up the project on each machine. [**EACH USER SHOULD RUN THIS SCRIPT FIRST**]
* `R/00_Config_file` - The configuration file is the master file in terms of setting all criteria used throughout the repo, loading the required packages and saving settings throughout the repo.
* `R/01_run_project.R` - is the main script to run the project. It will run all the scripts in the correct order.

## Data

❗ **The data used in this project is NOT included in this repository** ❗

 The data is stored in a separate repository and is accessed can be downloaded from ZENODO: [![static-badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-10.5281/zenodo.11369243-yellow)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11369243)

After downloading the data, the data should be placed in the `Data` folder.

The data should be stored in the following structure:

``` r
Data/
├── Assembly/
├── C14/
├── Climate/
├── Events/
├── Predictor_models/
├── Spatial/
├── SPD/
└── Targets_data/
```

Then the `R/00_Config_file.R` (Section 4) should be updated with the correct path to the data.

### Reproducibility note

Due to the very large size of several subparts of the projects (SPDs, predictor models), the data is not included in the repository. However, the data contains the processed data and visualisation can be run without the data. In addition, the data can be generated by rerunning the whole project.
